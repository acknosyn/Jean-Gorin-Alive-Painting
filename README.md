# Jean Gorin Alive Painting
This Processing sketch is an interpretation of a work by Jean Gorin: Untitled constructivist composition. I've re-imagined the static image and given it life by animating it with human-like qualities.

Each component of the composition is wrapped in its own class. Please note: In order for the sketch to run, the files must be in a folder named 'Composition'.
